Time-varying estimate of the effective reproduction number (lightest ribbon = 90% credible interval; darker ribbon = the 50% credible interval, darkest ribbon = 20% credible interval).

Uncertainty has been curtailed to a maximum of ten times the maximum number of reported cases for plotting purposes.\n\n\nRegional Breakdown\nData availability\nCase counts by date, stratified by region, were downloaded from a public curated dataset (Abbott et al. 2020).\nCase onset dates were estimated using confirmed case counts by date of report and a distribution of reporting delays fitted to an international line-list (Xu et al., n.d.; Abbott et al. 2020).\nLimitations\nLine-list data to inform a Canadian specific estimate of the reporting delay was not available. This means that we could also not account for any regional differences.\n\n\n\nSummary of latest reproduction number and confirmed case count estimates by date of infection\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Confirmed cases with date of infection on the 2020-11-29 and the time-varying estimate of the effective reproduction number (lightest ribbon = 90% credible interval; darker ribbon = the 50% credible interval, darkest ribbon = 20% credible interval). Regions are ordered by the number of expected daily confirmed cases and shaded based on the expected change in daily confirmedcases. The horizontal dotted line indicates the target value of 1 for the effective reproduction no. required for control and a single case required for elimination.

This means that we could also not account for any regional differences.\n\n\n\nSummary of latest reproduction number and confirmed case count estimates by date of infection\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Confirmed cases with date of infection on the 2020-10-10 and the time-varying estimate of the effective reproduction number (lightest ribbon = 90% credible interval; darker ribbon = the 50% credible interval, darkest ribbon = 20% credible interval). Regions are ordered by the number of expected daily confirmed cases and shaded based on the expected change in daily confirmedcases. The horizontal dotted line indicates the target value of 1 for the effective reproduction no. required for control and a single case required for elimination. Uncertainty has been curtailed to a maximum of ten times the maximum number of reported cases for plotting purposes.\nReproduction numbers over time in the six regions expected to have the most new confirmed cases\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Time-varying estimate of the effective reproduction number (lightest ribbon = 90% credible interval; darker ribbon = the 50% credible interval, darkest ribbon = 20% credible interval) in the regions expected to have the highest number of new confirmed cases.

Estimates based on partial data have been adjusted for right truncation of infections. The vertical dashed line indicates the date of report generation. Uncertainty has been curtailed to a maximum of ten times the maximum number of reported cases for plotting purposes.\n\n\nComparing estimates from cases, admissions, and deaths data\nWe calculate Rt as the average of how many new infections arise from one infected person. However, each data source for Covid-19 infections (test-positive cases, hospital admissions, or deaths) represents a slightly different type of “average” person who has been infected. For example, when most new infections are spread between young people who may be less vulnerable to severe disease, the Rt from all test-positive cases rises quicker than the Rt calculated from patients in hospital. This happened in the UK in August. This comparison can help us track in real-time how Covid-19 is spreading in the most vulnerable populations.\nTo explore in more depth how Rt from different data sources can be used to understand transmission dynamics across the population, and a more detailed methodology, see our pre-print (Sherratt et al. 2020).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Estimates of Rt (median, with 50% (darker shade) and 90% (lightest shade) credible interval), derived from data sources including all test-positive cases, hospital admissions, and deaths with a positive test in the previous 28 days for the devolved authorities of the United Kingdom.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Estimates of Rt (median, with 50% (darker shade) and 90% (lightest shade) credible interval), derived from data sources including all test-positive cases, hospital admissions, and deaths with a positive test in the previous 28 days in the NHS regions of England.\n\n\n\nTable 2: Latest estimates of Rt, derived from data sources including all test-positive cases, hospital admissions, and deaths with a positive test in the previous 28 days. The median and 90% credible interval is shown. Latest dates vary for cases (2020-11-16), admissions (2020-11-18), and deaths (2020-11-09).\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"extensions\":[\"Buttons\"],\"data\":[[\"Northern Ireland\",\"North East and Yorkshire\",\"Midlands\",\"North West\",\"Scotland\",\"England\",\"South West\",\"London\",\"East of England\",\"Wales\",\"South East\",\"United Kingdom\"],[\"0.8 (0.72 -- 0.88)\",\"0.84 (0.79 -- 0.88)\",\"0.87 (0.82 -- 0.92)\",\"0.89 (0.84 -- 0.93)\",\"0.89 (0.83 -- 0.95)\",\"0.9 (0.86 -- 0.93)\",\"0.92 (0.85 -- 0.98)\",\"0.96 (0.89 -- 1.02)\",\"0.96 (0.89 -- 1.01)\",\"0.97 (0.92 -- 1.03)\",\"1 (0.96 -- 1.05)\",null],[\"0.87 (0.8 -- 0.93)\",\"0.7 (0.65 -- 0.75)\",\"0.76 (0.7 -- 0.82)\",\"0.75 (0.71 -- 0.8)\",\"0.89 (0.84 -- 0.94)\",\"0.78 (0.72 -- 0.83)\",\"0.7 (0.62 -- 0.77)\",\"0.86 (0.78 -- 0.93)\",\"0.88 (0.81 -- 0.93)\",\"1.14 (1.06 -- 1.21)\",\"0.86 (0.78 -- 0.93)\",\"0.8 (0.76 -- 0.85)\"],[\"0.9 (0.77 -- 1.02)\",\"0.89 (0.82 -- 0.95)\",\"0.99 (0.94 -- 1.04)\",\"0.85 (0.79 -- 0.89)\",\"0.79 (0.66 -- 0.89)\",\"0.96 (0.93 -- 1)\",\"1.11 (1.02 -- 1.19)\",\"1.08 (1 -- 1.13)\",\"0.98 (0.9 -- 1.05)\",\"0.9 (0.8 -- 0.98)\",\"1.06 (0.99 -- 1.13)\",\"0.95 (0.92 -- 0.99)\"]],\"container\":\"<table class=\\\"display\\\">\\n  <thead>\\n    <tr>\\n      <th>Region<\\/th>\\n      <th>Hospital admissions<\\/th>\\n      <th>Test-positives<\\/th>\\n      <th>Deaths<\\/th>\\n    <\\/tr>\\n  <\\/thead>\\n<\\/table>\",\"options\":{\"dom\":\"Bfrtip\",\"buttons\":[\"csv\"],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}\nRegional Breakdown\nData availability\nCase counts by date, stratified by region, were downloaded from a public curated dataset (“Coronavirus (Covid-19) Cases in the Uk” 2020; White 2020; Abbott et al. 2020).\nCase onset dates were estimated using confirmed case counts by date of report and a distribution of reporting delays fitted to an international line-list (Xu et al., n.d.; Abbott et al. 2020).\nLimitations\nLine-list data to inform a United Kingdom specific estimate of the reporting delay was not available.
