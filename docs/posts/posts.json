These results are impacted by changes in testing effort, increases and decreases in testing effort will increase and decrease reproduction number estimates respectively.",

Time-varying estimate of the effective reproduction number (lightest ribbon = 90% credible interval; darker ribbon = the 50% credible interval, darkest ribbon = 20% credible interval).

Estimates based on partial data have been adjusted for right truncation of infections. The vertical dashed line indicates the date of report generation. Uncertainty has been curtailed to a maximum of ten times the maximum number of reported cases for plotting purposes.\n\n\nComparing estimates from cases, admissions, and deaths data\nWe calculate Rt as the average of how many new infections arise from one infected person. However, each data source for Covid-19 infections (test-positive cases, hospital admissions, or deaths) represents a slightly different type of “average” person who has been infected. For example, when most new infections are spread between young people who may be less vulnerable to severe disease, the Rt from all test-positive cases rises quicker than the Rt calculated from patients in hospital. This happened in the UK in August. This comparison can help us track in real-time how Covid-19 is spreading in the most vulnerable populations.\nTo explore in more depth how Rt from different data sources can be used to understand transmission dynamics across the population, and a more detailed methodology, see our pre-print (Sherratt et al. 2020).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Estimates of Rt (median, with 50% (darker shade) and 90% (lightest shade) credible interval), derived from data sources including all test-positive cases, hospital admissions, and deaths with a positive test in the previous 28 days for the devolved authorities of the United Kingdom.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Estimates of Rt (median, with 50% (darker shade) and 90% (lightest shade) credible interval), derived from data sources including all test-positive cases, hospital admissions, and deaths with a positive test in the previous 28 days in the NHS regions of England.\n\n\n\nTable 2: Latest estimates of Rt, derived from data sources including all test-positive cases, hospital admissions, and deaths with a positive test in the previous 28 days. The median and 90% credible interval is shown. Latest dates vary for cases (2020-11-16), admissions (2020-11-18), and deaths (2020-11-09).\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"extensions\":[\"Buttons\"],\"data\":[[\"Northern Ireland\",\"North East and Yorkshire\",\"Midlands\",\"North West\",\"Scotland\",\"England\",\"South West\",\"London\",\"East of England\",\"Wales\",\"South East\",\"United Kingdom\"],[\"0.8 (0.72 -- 0.88)\",\"0.84 (0.79 -- 0.88)\",\"0.87 (0.82 -- 0.92)\",\"0.89 (0.84 -- 0.93)\",\"0.89 (0.83 -- 0.95)\",\"0.9 (0.86 -- 0.93)\",\"0.92 (0.85 -- 0.98)\",\"0.96 (0.89 -- 1.02)\",\"0.96 (0.89 -- 1.01)\",\"0.97 (0.92 -- 1.03)\",\"1 (0.96 -- 1.05)\",null],[\"0.87 (0.8 -- 0.93)\",\"0.7 (0.65 -- 0.75)\",\"0.76 (0.7 -- 0.82)\",\"0.75 (0.71 -- 0.8)\",\"0.89 (0.84 -- 0.94)\",\"0.78 (0.72 -- 0.83)\",\"0.7 (0.62 -- 0.77)\",\"0.86 (0.78 -- 0.93)\",\"0.88 (0.81 -- 0.93)\",\"1.14 (1.06 -- 1.21)\",\"0.86 (0.78 -- 0.93)\",\"0.8 (0.76 -- 0.85)\"],[\"0.9 (0.77 -- 1.02)\",\"0.89 (0.82 -- 0.95)\",\"0.99 (0.94 -- 1.04)\",\"0.85 (0.79 -- 0.89)\",\"0.79 (0.66 -- 0.89)\",\"0.96 (0.93 -- 1)\",\"1.11 (1.02 -- 1.19)\",\"1.08 (1 -- 1.13)\",\"0.98 (0.9 -- 1.05)\",\"0.9 (0.8 -- 0.98)\",\"1.06 (0.99 -- 1.13)\",\"0.95 (0.92 -- 0.99)\"]],\"container\":\"<table class=\\\"display\\\">\\n  <thead>\\n    <tr>\\n      <th>Region<\\/th>\\n      <th>Hospital admissions<\\/th>\\n      <th>Test-positives<\\/th>\\n      <th>Deaths<\\/th>\\n    <\\/tr>\\n  <\\/thead>\\n<\\/table>\",\"options\":{\"dom\":\"Bfrtip\",\"buttons\":[\"csv\"],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}\nRegional Breakdown\nData availability\nCase counts by date, stratified by region, were downloaded from a public curated dataset (“Coronavirus (Covid-19) Cases in the Uk” 2020; White 2020; Abbott et al. 2020).\nCase onset dates were estimated using confirmed case counts by date of report and a distribution of reporting delays fitted to an international line-list (Xu et al., n.d.; Abbott et al. 2020).\nLimitations\nLine-list data to inform a United Kingdom specific estimate of the reporting delay was not available.

The median and 90% credible interval is shown. \n\n{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"extensions\":[\"Buttons\"],\"data\":[[\"East of England\",\"England\",\"London\",\"Midlands\",\"North East and Yorkshire\",\"North West\",\"Northern Ireland\",\"Scotland\",\"South East\",\"South West\",\"United Kingdom\",\"Wales\"],[\"820 (462 -- 1792)\",\"7251 (3848 -- 17201)\",\"1834 (802 -- 4705)\",\"1213 (624 -- 2673)\",\"797 (387 -- 1795)\",\"715 (452 -- 1213)\",\"239 (122 -- 510)\",\"513 (309 -- 791)\",\"1549 (717 -- 4374)\",\"278 (114 -- 933)\",\"10545 (5545 -- 18697)\",\"1383 (699 -- 2604)\"],[\"Unsure\",\"Unsure\",\"Unsure\",\"Unsure\",\"Unsure\",\"Unsure\",\"Unsure\",\"Unsure\",\"Unsure\",\"Unsure\",\"Unsure\",\"Unsure\"],[\"0.9 (0.7 -- 1.4)\",\"0.8 (0.6 -- 1.4)\",\"1 (0.7 -- 1.7)\",\"0.7 (0.5 -- 1.1)\",\"0.7 (0.5 -- 1.1)\",\"0.8 (0.6 -- 1)\",\"0.9 (0.6 -- 1.3)\",\"0.8 (0.6 -- 1)\",\"1 (0.6 -- 1.7)\",\"0.7 (0.4 -- 1.4)\",\"1 (0.7 -- 1.3)\",\"1.1 (0.8 -- 1.5)\"],[\"-0.02 (-0.09 -- 0.11)\",\"-0.04 (-0.12 -- 0.09)\",\"0.01 (-0.1 -- 0.18)\",\"-0.08 (-0.15 -- 0.03)\",\"-0.09 (-0.16 -- 0.03)\",\"-0.07 (-0.12 -- 0)\",\"-0.03 (-0.11 -- 0.07)\",\"-0.05 (-0.1 -- 0)\",\"-0.01 (-0.1 -- 0.18)\",\"-0.09 (-0.17 -- 0.09)\",\"-0.01 (-0.1 -- 0.07)\",\"0.03 (-0.07 -- 0.14)\"],[\"-32.2 (6.4 -- -8)\",\"-16.2 (7.3 -- -6)\",\"113.1 (3.8 -- -6.8)\",\"-8.4 (25.1 -- -4.6)\",\"-8 (26.7 -- -4.3)\",\"-10.1 (-629.1 -- -5.9)\",\"-20.6 (9.4 -- -6.4)\",\"-13.7 (-436.4 -- -6.7)\",\"-130.7 (3.9 -- -6.8)\",\"-8 (7.4 -- -4)\",\"-57.2 (9.3 -- -6.9)\",\"23.9 (4.9 -- -9.7)\"]],\"container\":\"<table class=\\\"display\\\">\\n  <thead>\\n    <tr>\\n      <th>Region<\\/th>\\n      <th>New confirmed cases by infection date<\\/th>\\n      <th>Expected change in daily cases<\\/th>\\n      <th>Effective reproduction no.<\\/th>\\n      <th>Rate of growth<\\/th>\\n      <th>Doubling/halving time (days)<\\/th>\\n    <\\/tr>\\n  <\\/thead>\\n<\\/table>\",\"options\":{\"dom\":\"Bfrtip\",\"buttons\":[\"csv\"],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbott, Sam, Katharine Sherratt, Jonnie Bevan, Hamish Gibbs, Joel Hellewell, James Munday, Patrick Barks, Paul Campbell, Flavio Finger, and Sebastian Funk. 2020. “Covidregionaldata: Subnational Data for the Covid-19 Outbreak.” - - (-): –. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3957539.\n\n\n“Coronavirus (Covid-19) Cases in the Uk.” 2020.
