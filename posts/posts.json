These results are impacted by changes in testing effort, increases and decreases in testing effort will increase and decrease reproduction number estimates respectively.",

Uncertainty has been curtailed to a maximum of ten times the maximum number of reported cases for plotting purposes.\n\n\nRegional Breakdown\nData availability\nCase counts by date, stratified by region, were downloaded from a public curated dataset (Abbott et al. 2020).\nCase onset dates were estimated using confirmed case counts by date of report and a distribution of reporting delays fitted to an international line-list (Xu et al., n.d.; Abbott et al. 2020).\nLimitations\nLine-list data to inform a Canadian specific estimate of the reporting delay was not available. This means that we could also not account for any regional differences.\n\n\n\nSummary of latest reproduction number and confirmed case count estimates by date of infection\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Confirmed cases with date of infection on the 2020-12-10 and the time-varying estimate of the effective reproduction number (lightest ribbon = 90% credible interval; darker ribbon = the 50% credible interval, darkest ribbon = 20% credible interval). Regions are ordered by the number of expected daily confirmed cases and shaded based on the expected change in daily confirmedcases. The horizontal dotted line indicates the target value of 1 for the effective reproduction no. required for control and a single case required for elimination.

This means that we could also not account for any regional differences.\n\n\n\nSummary of latest reproduction number and confirmed case count estimates by date of infection\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Confirmed cases with date of infection on the 2020-12-09 and the time-varying estimate of the effective reproduction number (lightest ribbon = 90% credible interval; darker ribbon = the 50% credible interval, darkest ribbon = 20% credible interval).

This means that we could also not account for any regional differences.\n\n\n\nSummary of latest reproduction number and confirmed case count estimates by date of infection\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Confirmed cases with date of infection on the 2020-12-10 and the time-varying estimate of the effective reproduction number (lightest ribbon = 90% credible interval; darker ribbon = the 50% credible interval, darkest ribbon = 20% credible interval).

Time-varying estimate of the effective reproduction number (lightest ribbon = 90% credible interval; darker ribbon = the 50% credible interval, darkest ribbon = 20% credible interval). Estimates from existing data are shown up to the 2020-12-05 from when forecasts are shown. These should be considered indicative only. Estimates based on partial data have been adjusted for right truncation of infections. The vertical dashed line indicates the date of report generation. Uncertainty has been curtailed to a maximum of ten times the maximum number of reported cases for plotting purposes.\n\n\nComparing estimates from cases, admissions, and deaths data\nWe calculate Rt as the average of how many new infections arise from one infected person. However, each data source for Covid-19 infections (test-positive cases, hospital admissions, or deaths) represents a slightly different type of “average” person who has been infected. For example, when most new infections are spread between young people who may be less vulnerable to severe disease, the Rt from all test-positive cases rises quicker than the Rt calculated from patients in hospital. This happened in the UK in August. This comparison can help us track in real-time how Covid-19 is spreading in the most vulnerable populations.\nTo explore in more depth how Rt from different data sources can be used to understand transmission dynamics across the population, and a more detailed methodology, see our pre-print (Sherratt et al. 2020).\nNote that the latest date shown for estimates is based on the most recent date that we believe to have a reliable count. In the UK, this lags behind the current date by several days. This is because of the delay in reporting an event. For example, a positive test can take up to five days to be reported in public data, meaning that data less than five days old will not include all positive tests for that day. This lag also varies by data source, where we account for a longer delay in reporting deaths compared to hospital admissions or positive tests.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Raw data counts with 7-day moving average; and estimates of Rt (lightest ribbon = 90% credible interval; darker ribbon = the 50% credible interval, darkest ribbon = 20% credible interval). Rt derived from data sources including all test-positive cases, hospital admissions, and deaths with a positive test in the previous 28 days for the devolved authorities of the United Kingdom.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Raw data counts with 7-day moving average; and estimates of Rt (lightest ribbon = 90% credible interval; darker ribbon = the 50% credible interval, darkest ribbon = 20% credible interval). Rt derived from data sources including all test-positive cases, hospital admissions, and deaths with a positive test in the previous 28 days in the NHS regions of England.\n\n\n\nTable 2: Latest estimates of Rt, derived from data sources including all test-positive cases, hospital admissions, and deaths with a positive test in the previous 28 days. The median and 90% credible interval is shown.
